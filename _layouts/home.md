Welcome to my portfolio website hosted on github pages!

I am a current graduate student at Virginia Tech pursuing a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Technologies. For me this is centered around Virtual Reality, Games, and Immersive environments with a focus on interactivity and environmental storytelling.

I have proficiency in The Unity and Unreal Engines. I also have working experience with Maya, Blender, OptiTrack Motive, Facewear Facial Motion Capture,  and Depth Kit Volumetric Capture. Other skills are on display in my projects which can be found in the Portfolio tab.
