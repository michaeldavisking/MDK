I am a Creative Technologies MFA student at Virginia Tech set to graduate in 2026. I work primarily with Virtual Reality and Games which I work on alone and with teams.

When I first opened the Unity Game Engine in 2018 I was excited to make games. I found the process challengingm, but enjoyed the support from the large community found in game design. Since then I have worked with other students, colleagues, and international teams on personal projects and game jams. I have also expanded my Game Engine knowledge into Unreal Engine 5 and gained familiarity with Reaper Audio and Blender to make my own assets.

I do not only make games for the hope of making money, instead I make games because I enjoy the process and learning that comes with them. I appreciate the challenges that are presented to me when approaching new concepts in game engines and find satisfaction in the collaboration inherent in game design. I hope to build my skills throughout my life and help others do the same.
