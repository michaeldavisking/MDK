## Particles

**Introduction**

For the Fall 2025 Bird Block exhibition I displayed a wool on wood sculpture titled “Gregory” that is planned to be a full animatronic. A single constructed arm was displayed along with the body of the sculpture and was manually moved as a demonstration a handful of times.

This Exhibition was hosted at Bird Block Ceramics Studio in Blacksburg VA. I planned the event, organized displayed work, and secured funding for the reception.

**Description of Materials and Process**
Gregory is assembled with a wood frame and a wood skin. For the knit sections of his skin I started working several months in advance so I could get acquainted with the process and experiment with how I wanted the knit to skin the sculpture.

For the frame, which I started a few months after knitting. I had an idea from when I wanted to work Virtual Reality into the sculpture that it should be large enough to fit a person under it. Even when I moved away from VR and toward the sculpture being the presence and immersion in the space a large size stuck with me. So I went to work on the frame as a triangle that was large enough to fit a person under. I like the way that a triangular base for the form forces the perspective to mainly view it from the tip or the side. It blocks a large portion of the rest of the sculpture but shows enough that you can be drawn over to it. I built the frame and lightly dressed it in the knitting I had, then took it apart and fully reassembled it. The frame needed more strength but I wanted to maintain an amount of modularity. I divided the frame into three parts. A Wood joined a large lower frame and an upper frame along with a series of thick and thin dowels. The top frame was screwed together to hold the weight of the rest of the frame and eventually the sculpture's arms and skin, but the dowel rods remained held in only through friction from tight tolerance drilled holes.

The skin for the frame is a combination of knit and felted sheep wool.I became quickly invested in working from as raw a material as possible for wool. I appreciate a technical challenge and the steps of washing and processing wool are sensitive and time consuming in a way that I find very rewarding. I got raw local Romeldale wool from Sunrise Valley Farm, a vendor at the Blacksburg farmers market. Raw wool needs a series of cold water washes and then a series of hot water washes. The difficulty is that there is lanolin, a natural oil from sheep, along with dirt, bugs, and a wealthy helping of feces. All that material needs to be removed without agitating the fibers which would prematurely felt them and ruin the batch. It forces you to be grounded in the process, to pay attention to the feel of the fibers and the color of the water. Just like with knitting, it's a process that necessitates patience and leaves you with space to think. I spend that time thinking about the shape I want the fabric to hold when its laid out on the frame, how I want the light to shine through it, and how long I want it to last when confronted with human touch.

When it is washed it air dries then I take it and run it through a drum carder to pull out the fibers into roving which can then be felted. When I first started I did not have a drum carder, I instead used a dog brush to pull the fiber out by hand which takes many more hours. I was lucky to find one from the thrift store under the advice of Rude Graves at Brid Block Ceramics Studio.
After the fibers are cleaned and pulled out, a process that is at a minimum three days, I can then felt it. This part to me feels slightly ironic. A huge amount of time is spent protecting the fiber from agitation so that you can pour hot soapy water on it and agitate it. I take the roving and pull it into pieces that are laid in a similar pattern to roofing shingles, then hot water with dish soap is showered over the top and two pieces of bubble wrap are used to agitate the fibers into fusing. This is done first by moving your hands along the surface then by rolling the fiber up in the bubble wrap and moving it back and forth. All the while I maintain a watchful eye for the level of felt that I want. Too much and I lose the lines in the fabric, too little and it won't be strong enough to last the course of the display. Rigidity matters too for the parts that skin the arms as if the fabric can't flex then it will bunch oddly around the flex points in the arm.  
I make the felt using two kinds of roving. The first is the roving that I make myself which is the underside, and then a purchased roving from Sunrise Valley Farms which is the top layer. The hand washed roving is still more oily than it should be and wont come together as well as the purchased one. It also has more variation in color which I don't want to be immediately present on the sculpture. By layering it this way I can give Gregory a consistent exterior complexion that gains depth when it is light from the inside.

For the making of the arm and future arms for the project I would like to direct you to Posts where a full video breaks down the play by play of the arms.

I would anticipate an even more detailed breakdown of the process when I finish my masters thesis in spring of 2026. If you have questions about this project please feel free to contact me at michaeldavisking@gmail.com or through the email button on my landing page!
