## Particles

**Introduction**

Put Me On builds on Particles to introduce a sound activated interactable particle. Guests at the Bird Block exhibition were asked to explore the range of colors that are created through changes in pitch which will change the rgb values of the particle texture in real time.

**Development**

Put Me On uses Particles as a template project, changing the spline to a single point of attraction that will slowly pull in all the particles. Guests are able to move the particles with their hands using an expanded physics interaction that places point forces on each xr hand joint allowing for high fidelity interaction. The volume of the person in the headset will also control the rate at which the particles move on their own through randomized physics forces.

**Display**

Particles was displayed in a small back room of Bird Block Gallery and Ceramics Studio in Blacksburg Virginia. It ran without interruption for several hours with no technical issues.
