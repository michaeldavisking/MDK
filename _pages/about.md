I am a Creative Technologies MFA student at Virginia Tech set to graduate in 2026. I specialize in Virtual Reality and game design in the Unreal and Unity game engines. This includes the creation of 3D assets optimized for game and VR experiences.

I am familiar with Adobe Premier, Substance Painter, Illustrator, and Audition. I also work with Maya, Bender, and Zbrush.

When I first opened the Unity Game Engine in 2018 I was excited to make games. I found the process challenging, but enjoyed the support from the large community found in game design. Since then I have worked with other students, colleagues, and international teams on personal projects, game jams, and professional simulations.

I make games because I enjoy the technical process and learning that comes with them. I appreciate the challenges that are presented to me when approaching new concepts in game engines and find satisfaction in the collaboration inherent in game design. I hope to build my skills throughout my life and help others do the same.
